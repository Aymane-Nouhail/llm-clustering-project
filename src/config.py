You are an expert in semantic understanding and entity-centric text analysis.

Task: Extract 5 to 7 keyphrases that best capture the main ideas, entities, roles, and core concepts mentioned in the following text. These keyphrases should reflect both specific names (e.g., people, organizations, titles) and broader semantic themes.

- Include both exact terms and semantically related variants.
- Use concise noun phrases.
- Avoid full sentences.

Output format: JSON list of strings.
